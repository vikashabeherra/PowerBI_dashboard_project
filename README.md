# PowerBI_dashboard_project
Iâ€™m excited to share a dynamic Mobile Sales Dashboard that I designed and developed using Power BI, leveraging DAX queries and insightfulÂ dataÂ analysis !
<br>
Total Sales, Transactions, and Average Price insights.
<br>
Breakdown of metrics by City, Month, Mobile Model, Brand, and Payment Method.
<br>
Key trends like Total Quantity by Month, Customer Ratings, and Transaction Preferences (Cash, UPI, etc.).
<br>
Year-over-Year Comparisons to uncover growthÂ patterns.
<br>

ðŸ’¡ Highlights:

â¿¡ Interactive filters for seamless analysis.
<br>
â¿¢ Comprehensive views of sales data across multiple dimensions.
<br>
â¿£ Visualizations that simplify complex data for easyÂ understanding.
