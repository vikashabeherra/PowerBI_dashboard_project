# PowerBI_dashboard_project
Iâ€™m excited to share a dynamic Mobile Sales Dashboard that I designed and developed using Power BI, leveraging DAX queries and insightfulÂ dataÂ analysis !
Total Sales, Transactions, and Average Price insights.
Breakdown of metrics by City, Month, Mobile Model, Brand, and Payment Method.
Key trends like Total Quantity by Month, Customer Ratings, and Transaction Preferences (Cash, UPI, etc.).
Year-over-Year Comparisons to uncover growthÂ patterns.

ðŸ’¡ Highlights:

â¿¡ Interactive filters for seamless analysis.
â¿¢ Comprehensive views of sales data across multiple dimensions.
â¿£ Visualizations that simplify complex data for easyÂ understanding.
